Challenge for Week 9 Create a portfolio using react

## Installation and Setup

## Instructions

1. **Setting Up Vite**: Use the command below to create your new Vite project with a React template:

   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest my-first-react-app
   ```

   - Select a Framework, choose React
   - Select a Variant, choose Javascript

2. Navigating and Installing:
   - Navigate into your project folder
   ```bash
   cd my-first-react-app
   ```
   - Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   2.a To use bootstrap install
   This gives you Bootstrap-styled components as React elements â€” no need to manually write class names.

```bash
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
```

3. Launching the App:

- Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Open the provided local server address (usually http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view your app, but check the console to see the URL the app is running on.
